# Machine Learning and Data Science Projects
This repository is a collection of my practice notebooks for machine learning and data science. Each notebook demonstrates a step-by-step approach to solving problems, from data preparation to model building. These projects showcase my skills and my passion for continuous learning in this field.

Skills
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Core Concepts: Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Model Building, and Evaluation.

Projects Highlights
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
I have used various techniques to prepare and clean raw data for modeling.

Missing Values: Handled missing data using methods like back-fill, forward-fill, and mode imputation.

Outliers: Identified and removed outliers using both Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR) methods.

Data Transformation: Applied Normalization, Feature Scaling, and Function Transformers to prepare data for models.

Encoding: Converted categorical data to a numerical format using Label Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, and One-Hot Encoding.

Data Splitting: Practiced splitting data into training and testing sets to properly evaluate model performance.

2. Regression Models
I have worked with different types of regression to predict continuous values.

Linear Regression: Implemented Simple, Multiple, and Polynomial Linear Regression.

Regularization: Used Lasso Regularization to prevent model overfitting.

Feature Selection: Applied Backward Elimination to select the most important features for a model.

3. Classification Models
I have experience with classification to predict discrete outcomes.

Logistic Regression: Built models for Binary and Multiclass Classification, including the use of polynomial features for non-linear problems.
